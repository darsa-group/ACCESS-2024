Recent developments in machine learning and AI are [transforming research in entomology and insect ecology](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2002545117). However, there are too few opportunities to learn how to develop and apply these transformative methods and technologies.
To fill this gap, we started the **Aarhus  Comprehensive Computational Entomology Summer School**: a five-day course to learn how to apply state-of-the-art **imaging**, **deep-learning** and **AI** methods to **insect ecology and entomology**.

## Where and when
ACCESS-2024 is an **in-person, residential summer school** based in the beautiful **Mols Bjerge National Park** near Aarhus, Denmark. The event will run from **September 30th** to **October 4th, 2024**. [Aarhus University](https://international.au.dk/) is a highly ranked institution, located in a vibrant city, with several researchers leading the field of computational entomology.

## What we offer
* • A fully-funded course - **free tuition, accommodation and food** for the selected candidates
* • A series of **guest lectures** and **practical workshops** from international experts
* • A **project-based** learning experience within a **multidisciplinary student team**
* • Unfortunately we cannot fund travel to or from the summer school

## Who the course is for
* • Early career researchers (graduate students, PhD and postdocs)
* • Biologists (entomologists, ecologists, etc) wanting to apply computational methods to their fields
* • Data scientists (engineers, physicists, etc) seeking to translate their expertise to study insects

## How to take part
* • Read the [application section](#application)
* • Fill the [application form](https://forms.gle/5nepSFsC4tcBWbG88)
