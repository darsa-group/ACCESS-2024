We can accommodate a maximum of **20 outstanding candidates** during our five day residential course.

### Course requirements
The course is designed for early career researchers interested in computational entomology, whether they come from a biological or data science background. Specific requirements are as follows:
* Programming experience -- Candidates must demonstrate at least basic programming skills, ideally in python. Otherwise, candidates will be expected to develop those skills by the start of the course.
* Time commitment -- You must confirm that, if selected, **you will be able to dedicate time** to prepare for the course (30h, remotely) and then physically attend the 5-day event.
* Above all, candidates must be **excited** to apply new technologies and methods to answer interesting biological questions!

### Selection process
We will assess the motivation, competence and vision of applicants using this [application form](https://forms.gle/5nepSFsC4tcBWbG88). The form requests the following:
* Motivation (PDF) -- You will need to provide a 1-page motivation statement explaining your background, **why you are interested in the topic**, and what you hope to gain from the summer school. Ensure you explain what you have already done in this direction.
* CV  (PDF) -- You must provide a CV, which will help us understand **your background, seniority and current expertise**. 
* Project idea (PDF) -- Importantly, this course is project-based. You must describe, in **1500 characters**, **a specific research question or problem you (or others) have or (will have)**, related to insect ecology, behaviour, entomology, etc. Ensure you explain both the biological context and how this course would help you address this issue. 
Do not be afraid of being creative and thinking out of the box: your project could be to monitor behaviour in the field or in the lab; to detect or quantify traits in insect specimens; to build novel hardware or mobile applications; to automate a task you can already do or to obtain new content. We are interested in any project related to computational entomology, and will consider projects related to other terrestrial invertebrates.

### Matching process
We will also ask you several additional questions during your application. Should you be selected, we will use this information to form teams of candidates based on complementary skills and interests.

To complete your application, please fill out the [application form](https://forms.gle/5nepSFsC4tcBWbG88) **by XX the XX of XX**.
