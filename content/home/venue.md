### The Mols Laboratory

Summer school participants will get free food and board at the [Mols Laboratory research station](https://www.naturhistoriskmuseum.dk/mols-laboratory/a-wilder-mols-laboratory).

Situated in the beautiful Mols Bjerge National Park, participants will develop new skills while immersed in Danish wildlife. Having recently become a "Nature National Park", Mols Bjerge is home to a rewilding project in which Exmoor ponies and Galloway cattle are allowed to roam freely across large areas of the estate.

During automated monitoring field tests and extra-curricular excursions, participants will experience these rewilding agents in action, as well as the results of the rewilding process.
