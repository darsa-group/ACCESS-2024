However, there are too few opportunities to learn how to develop and apply these transformative methods and technologies. To fill this gap, we started the Aarhus Comprehensive Computational Entomology Summer School: a five-day course to learn how to apply state-of-the-art imaging, deep-learning and AI methods to insect ecology and entomology.\nWhere and when ACCESS-2024 is an in-person, residential summer school based in the beautiful Mols Bjerge National Park near Aarhus, Denmark. The event will run from September 30th to October 4th, 2024. Aarhus University is a highly ranked institution, located in a vibrant city, with several researchers leading the field of computational entomology.\nWhat we offer • A fully-funded course - free tuition, accommodation and food for the selected candidates • A series of guest lectures and practical workshops from international experts • A project-based learning experience within a multidisciplinary student team • Unfortunately we cannot fund travel to or from the summer school Who the course is for • Early career researchers (graduate students, PhD and postdocs) • Biologists (entomologists, ecologists, etc) wanting to apply computational methods to their fields • Data scientists (engineers, physicists, etc) seeking to translate their expertise to study insects How to take part • Read the application section • Fill the application form ","date":1607817600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1607817600,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"Recent developments in machine learning and AI are transforming research in entomology and insect ecology.
