      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jarrett completed his PhD in Zoology at the University of British Columbia, where he investigated applied methods of computer vision for ecology. Broadly, Jarrett is interested in using computer vision for bulk insect specimen processing. More specifically, much of his work explores the integration of data modalities such as DNA and spatiotemporal metadata within computer vision classification pipelines. Through integrating diverse data types with computer vision, Jarrett aims to significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of cataloging insect specimens, contributing to broader ecological and conservation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jenna is a biodiversity scientist specialising in the use of technology, such as acosutics, cameras and robotics, to monitor and conserve biodiversity. Jenna completed her PhD at Imperial College London in 2021 where she used bioacoustics and machine learning to monitor the Geoffory&amp;rsquo;s spider monkey and investigate the effects of palm and teak plantations on biodiversity. She then spent two years working for the Robotics department at EPFL in Switzerland and Imperial College London where she used robotics and acoustics to monitor freshwater and forested ecosystems across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At UK CEH Jenna manages an international network of automated biodiversity monitoring equipment being used to understand the effects of anthropogenic change within tropical ecosystems and the impacts of sustainable farming on biodiversity in the UK. Jenna is interested in how we can use technology to better understand and conserve biodiversity, especially with the increasing threats posed by extreme climatic events. Jenna works with partners globally to support nature conservation and sits on the board of two oveseas NGOs. She has a keen interest in outreach activities has developed her own audio-visual immersive experience which can be viewed here, and has presented and exhibited at many public events including festivals, museums and conferences. Additionally, Jenna is interested in the interface between art and science and how we can use art as a tool for outreach.&lt;/p&gt;
